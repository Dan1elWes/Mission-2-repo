        <h1>What Does "Souls-Borne" Even Mean?</h1>
        <br />
        <p>
          The "Souls-like" name has been adopted by a number of critics and
          developers. However, there have also been questions whether it is a
          true genre or a collection of shared mechanics. A subset of these
          games, named Souls-Borne, refer to most of the Souls-like games
          developed by FromSoftware themselves such as game titles like the Dark
          Souls Trilogy, Bloodborne and most recently Elden Ring. Souls-Borne
          usually refers to games that are directly developed by FromSoftware
          where as Souls-like will refer to games that may have been inspired by
          the Souls-Borne games and features some shared mechanics similar to
          these games.
        </p>
        <br />

        <h1>What Type Of Games Are They?</h1>
        <br />
        <p>
          Souls-Borne games fall into the RPG, Action and Fantasy categories.
          These games will thrust you into a universe with an over arching story
          about the world your in with a grim dark atmosphere which sets a
          sinister tone. You'll discover new areas with their own lore and
          history aswell as other characters or NPC's with their own back story
          and motives. Your Character (You, the Player) will traverse this world
          and encounter challenging obstacles like different enemy types and
          bosses, or even the greatest enemy of all, Gravity. You'll have a
          variety of weaponry to choose, find, and utilise to help you in these
          endeavors such as Straight Swords, Spears, Halberds, Great Swords,
          Scythes, Sorceries, Holy Incantations, Crossbows, Bows, Great Bows,
          Shields, Maces, Great Hammers, theres a weapon type out there for you.
        </p>

        <h1>Is There An Easy Mode/Difficulty Slider?</h1>
        <br />
        <p>
          HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh There
          actually is, It's in the same place as where you'll be banging your
          head against the same wall for hours on end until you 'Git Gud' and
          overcome the challenge in front of you. These games thrive off the
          adrenaline you get from beating and overcoming that boss you've been
          fighting for the last 4 hours. The Souls-Borne games are known for for
          their difficulty and for not being able to change the difficulty to
          make things easier for yourself, but the magic of these games comes
          from that and it will test your patience.
